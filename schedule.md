This schedule is just a suggestion and will be updated following the first class period.

The above assignments are for this specific version of the course, but other assignments are available as well. You can see the full list of [assignments]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/), which may be useful if you're using this material outside of an organized course.

<!-- Schedule Management
- Update the `assignments:` list with `title:` from `assignments/` files.
- Add 'Template' to `assignments:` to view the course template from `docs/`.
- The remaining content should be left AS IS.
