There are no assignments for this topic, but I would recommend you play around with using `rplotly` to create an interactive plot (either of your own data, or using the `chicks` dataset we used in the Data Viz week (hint:`data(chicks)`). This [cheatsheet](https://images.plot.ly/plotly-documentation/images/r_cheat_sheet.pdf) and the above tutorial in plotly should be enough to get you started.

Here is the [leaflet code]({{ site.baseurl}}/solutions/mdFiles/spatial-raster.Rmd) that we went over for Waffle Houses in Athens in class.
