RMarkdown is an important tool for doing reproducible research. It allows you to add narrative to your code without typing those annoying `#` signs. It can also be dynamic, so that you don't need to manually look up the effect size or standard deviation everytime something changes. Just click a button and it all happens automatically.

To get a handle on using RMarkdown, there a couple resources.

First, check out the [RMarkdown website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to check out the gallery of what is possible.

Then, start the [tutorial](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html). I would recommend reading at least through Lesson 4. There are example documents at the top of each lesson for you to play around with.

[Test drive RMarkdown](http://stat545.com/block007_first-use-rmarkdown.html). This is a great tutorial by the wonderful Jenny Bryan that should get you comfortable using RMarkdown.

It may seem like a pain, but it is good practice to do the rest of your work this semester in RMarkdown. It will help you learn and make your work easier to read for others (and yourself!).
